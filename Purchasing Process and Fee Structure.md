**The Process and Fee Structure for Purchasing Agent Service.**

# Purchase of Brand New Items

## Let the Agent Open and Inspect

1. The buyer selects the item and entrusts the agent to negotiate the price. After the agent, buyer, and seller reach an agreement, the buyer pays the item price to the agent.
2. The agent purchases the item and waits for its arrival (usually about 3 days).
3. Upon receiving the item, the agent opens and inspects it, records a video to check for defects, and sends the inspection video to the buyer.
4. The buyer confirms the item is correct based on the images and video sent by the agent, chooses the shipping method, and pays for the shipping and agent fees.

- If the item is counterfeit or has **obvious defects recognized by the trading platform**, the buyer can exchange it or get a full refund.
- If the buyer unilaterally decides not to want the item, they can return it within the **no-questions-asked return policy period** (usually 7 days after receiving the item) and bear the return shipping cost for a refund.

5. After receiving the shipping and agent fees, the agent records a shipping video and sends the item to the buyer.

The agent fee for this method is 1.5% of the item price, with a minimum fee of \$7 and a maximum fee of \$49.

## Direct Purchase from Online Shopping Platforms (not recommended)

1. The buyer selects the item and entrusts the agent to negotiate the price. After the agent, buyer, and seller reach an agreement, the buyer pays the item price, shipping, and agent fees to the agent.
2. The agent directly purchases the item from the online shopping platform and arranges for it to be shipped to the buyer.

The agent fee for this method is 1% of the item price, with a minimum fee of \$7 and a maximum fee of \$39.

# Purchase of Second-hand Items

1. The buyer selects the item and entrusts the agent to negotiate the price. After the agent, buyer, and seller reach an agreement, the buyer pays the item price to the agent.
2. The agent purchases the item and waits for its arrival (usually about 3 days).
3. Upon receiving the item, the agent opens and inspects it, records a video to check for defects, and sends the inspection video to the buyer.
4. The buyer confirms the item is correct based on the images and video sent by the agent, chooses the shipping method, and pays for the shipping and agent fees.

- If the item is counterfeit or has **obvious defects recognized by the trading platform**, the buyer can exchange it or get a full refund.

5. After receiving the shipping and agent fees, the agent records a shipping video and sends the item to the buyer.

The agent fee for this method is 1.8% of the item price, with a minimum fee of \$9 and a maximum fee of \$69.

# Payment Methods

**Alipay** is the preferred payment method. Cross-border payment fee depends on the amount of the payment and your location (ususlly not much). You can ask the agent for payment QR code or tell the agent your Alipay account (phone number with country code) to receive a payment request.

If you use **PayPal** for payment, you will be charged a 5% cross-border payment fee, but the funds will be transferred quickly. My PayPal account is [paypal.me/hqywygd](https://paypal.me/hqywygd).

If you use a **bank card** for payment, you may be charged a flat fee of $9, with the exact rate varying depending on your bank. It usually takes a whole day for the funds to be transferred. The following is bank account information of the agent:

```
Destination country: China
SWIFT / BIC code: CMBCCNBS
Account number / IBAN: 6214855713710776
Account name: ZHANG CHENGYUAN
```

After the payment has been confirmed, the agent will send you a screenshot of the payment receipt. Therefore, if you can't use Alipay, it is generally recommended to make the first payment using a bank card, with an amount equal to or greater than the value of your order as a deposit. After the agent purchases the product, you can then use PayPal to pay for the shipping cost. The shipping cost you need to pay will be deducted the deposit amount that exceeds the product price and profit. If your deposit is more than the total of the product price, profit, and shipping cost, I will refund the excess amount to you via PayPal.

# Shipping

To ensure that your goods are delivered to your address promptly and accurately, please provide the following information in the specified format:

```
Country
Recipient's Full Name (Passport Name)
Detailed Address
Phone Number
State/Province
City
Postal Code
Email
Declared Value
```

## Declared Value

The declared value **may** affect customs duties. Declaring a higher value may result in higher costs if taxed, while declaring a lower value may increase the likelihood of customs inspections. If you are inexperienced in this matter, I can recommend a declared value for you. **I will try my best to help you avoid and save on costs.** None of my customers have been taxed so far.

## Shipping Fees

Various shipping options are available:

- Standard Economy Courier: For example, shipping to Hawaiian costs 135 RMB for the first 0.5 kg, and 35 RMB for each additional 0.5 kg. The delivery time is approximately 11 days. Shipping to Singapore or Malaysia costs 47 RMB per kg, with a delivery time of approximately 4 days.
- SF International Express: This option is roughly twice the price of the standard economy courier but offers faster delivery times, more convenience, and better service.

# Additional Notes

- If the product's warranty region is China and it is within the warranty period, the purchasing agent is obligated to contact the seller on behalf of the buyer to assist with warranty issues. However, overseas shipping cost for repairs must be borne by the buyer.
- The purchasing agent will proactively send all communication records with the seller and purchase records to the buyer to protect consumer rights.
- The purchasing agent will make every effort to help the buyer avoid customs duties. Although this is usually successful, if customs duties are imposed, they must be borne by the buyer.
- Please ensure that you inform the agent of the voltage standard in your area so that the appropriate voltage adapter can be selected for you. If the product cannot be used or is damaged due to not informing the agent of your local voltage standard, the agent will not be held responsible.
