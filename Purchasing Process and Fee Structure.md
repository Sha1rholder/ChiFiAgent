**The Process and Fee Structure for Purchasing Agent Service.**

# Purchase of Brand New Items

## Let the Agent Open and Inspect

1. The buyer selects the item and entrusts the agent to negotiate the price. After the agent, buyer, and seller reach an agreement, the buyer pays the item price to the agent.
2. The agent purchases the item and waits for its arrival (usually about 3 days).
3. Upon receiving the item, the agent opens and inspects it, records a video to check for defects, and sends the inspection video to the buyer.
4. The buyer confirms the item is correct based on the images and video sent by the agent, chooses the shipping method, and pays for the shipping and agent fees.

- If the item is counterfeit or has **obvious defects recognized by the trading platform**, the buyer can exchange it or get a full refund.
- If the buyer unilaterally decides not to want the item, they can return it within the **no-questions-asked return policy period** (usually 7 days after receiving the item) and bear the return shipping cost for a refund.

5. After receiving the shipping and agent fees, the agent records a shipping video and sends the item to the buyer.

The agent fee for this method is 1.5% of the item price, with a minimum fee of \$7 and a maximum fee of \$49.

## Direct Purchase from Online Shopping Platforms (not recommended)

1. The buyer selects the item and entrusts the agent to negotiate the price. After the agent, buyer, and seller reach an agreement, the buyer pays the item price, shipping, and agent fees to the agent.
2. The agent directly purchases the item from the online shopping platform and arranges for it to be shipped to the buyer.

The agent fee for this method is 1% of the item price, with a minimum fee of \$7 and a maximum fee of \$39.

# Purchase of Second-hand Items

# Payment Methods

If you use **PayPal** for payment, you will be charged a 5% cross-border payment fee, but the funds will be transferred quickly. My PayPal account is [paypal.me/hqywygd](https://paypal.me/hqywygd).

If you use a **bank card** for payment, you may be charged a flat fee of $9, with the exact rate varying depending on your bank. It usually takes a whole day for the funds to be transferred. The following is the bank account information for the agent (my mother actually):

Destination country: China  
SWIFT / BIC code: CMBCCNBS  
Account number / IBAN: 6214855713710776  
Account name: ZHANG CHENGYUAN

After the payment has been confirmed, the agent will send you a screenshot of the payment receipt. Therefore, it is generally recommended to make the first payment using a bank card, with an amount equal to or greater than the value of your order as a deposit. After the agent purchases the product, you can then use PayPal to pay for the shipping cost. The shipping cost you need to pay will be deducted the deposit amount that exceeds the product price and profit. If your deposit is more than the total of the product price, profit, and shipping cost, I will refund the excess amount to you via PayPal.

# Additional Notes

- If the product's warranty region is China and it is within the warranty period, the purchasing agent is obligated to contact the seller on behalf of the buyer to assist with warranty issues. However, the shipping cost for repairs must be borne by the buyer.
- The purchasing agent will proactively send all communication records with the seller and purchase records to the buyer to protect consumer rights.
- The purchasing agent will make every effort to help the buyer avoid customs duties. Although this is usually successful, if customs duties are imposed, they must be borne by the buyer.
- Please ensure that you inform the agent of the voltage standard in your area so that the appropriate voltage adapter can be selected for you. If the product cannot be used or is damaged due to not informing the agent of your local voltage standard, the agent will not be held responsible.
