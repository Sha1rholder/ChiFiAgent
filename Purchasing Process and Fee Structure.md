**The Process and Fee Structure for Purchasing Agent Service.**

# Purchase of Brand New Items

1. The buyer selects the item and entrusts the agent to negotiate the price. After the agent, buyer, and seller reach an agreement, the buyer pays at least **half of the item price** to the agent as deposit.
2. The agent purchases the item and waits for its arrival (usually about 3 days).
3. Upon receiving the item, the agent opens and inspects it, records a video to check for defects, and sends the inspection video to the buyer.
4. The buyer confirms the item is correct based on the images and video sent by the agent, chooses the shipping method, and pays for the rest of item price, shipping, and agent fees.

- If the item is counterfeit or has **obvious defects recognized by the trading platform**, the buyer can exchange it or get a full refund.
- If the buyer unilaterally decides not to want the item, they can return it within the **free return policy period** (usually 7 days after receiving the item) and bear the return shipping cost for a refund plus 20% of the deposit (maximum 200 rmb).

5. After receiving the shipping and agent fees, the agent records a shipping video and sends the item to the buyer.

The agent fee for this method is 1.5% of the item price, with a minimum fee of 49 rmb and a maximum fee of 349 rmb.

The agent fee for this method is 2% of the item price, with a minimum fee of 69 rmb and a maximum fee of 489 rmb.

# Payment Methods

**Alipay** is the preferred payment method. Cross-border payment fee depends on the amount of the payment and your location (ususlly not much). You can ask the agent for payment QR code or tell the agent your Alipay account (phone number with country code) to receive a payment request.

If you use **PayPal** for payment, you may be charged a 5% cross-border payment fee, but the funds will be transferred quickly. My PayPal account is [paypal.me/hqywygd](https://paypal.me/hqywygd).

If you use a **bank card** for payment, you may be charged a flat fee with the exact rate varying depending on your bank. It usually takes a whole day for the funds to be transferred. The following is bank account information of the agent:

```
Destination country: China
SWIFT / BIC code: CMBCCNBS or CMBCCNBSXXX
Beneficiary's Bank: China Merchants Bank,H.0.Shenzhen,China
Account number / IBAN: 6214 8557 1371 0776
Account name: ZHANG CHENGYUAN
CNAPS: 308331012079
Remark: (Please leave no remark if you agree. That may save a few time to explain to the bank for )
```

After the payment has been confirmed, you can ask the agent to send you a screenshot of receipt.

If you agree, please do not leave any remarks on the payment slip, as this can save some time. This is because banks generally do not require the recipient to explain the source of small cross-border remittances, but if there are remarks, the bank will ask me to provide some explanation. It's your freedom though.

Due to the high handling fees of PayPal, if you can't use Alipay, it is generally recommended to make the first payment using a bank card, with an amount equal to or greater than the value of your order as a deposit. After the agent purchases the product, you can then use PayPal to pay for the shipping cost to save some handling fee. The shipping cost you need to pay will be deducted the deposit amount that exceeds the product price and profit. If your deposit is more than the total of the product price, profit, and shipping cost, I will refund the excess amount to you via PayPal or any other methods you agree with.

# Shipping, Postage, and Delivery Time

To ensure that your goods are delivered to your address promptly and accurately, please provide the following information in the specified format:

```
Recipient's Full Name (Passport Name)
Country
State/Province
City
Detailed Address
Postal Code
Phone Number (including country code)
Email
Declared Value (optional)
Remarks (optional)
```

## Declared Value

The declared value **may** affect customs duties. Declaring a higher value may result in higher costs if taxed, while declaring a lower value may increase the likelihood of customs inspections. If you are inexperienced in this matter, I can recommend a declared value for you. **I will try my best to help you avoid and save on costs.** None of my customers have been taxed so far.

**I have never been charged any customs duties so far, but it's not guaranteed in the future.**

## Postage

**The following is for reference only. Postage and delivery time are subject to change over time.** A package roughly the size of a Hifiman Arya is typically considered equivalent to 2kg by courier companies. Here're some examples:

Shipping to Malaysia: (by air) first kilogram 28.5 RMB, additional 29.5 RMB per kilogram, with a delivery time of approximately 4 days; (by sea) first kilogram 20 RMB, additional 10.5 RMB per kilogram, with a delivery time of approximately 10 days or more.

Shipping to Netherlands: (by air + land) first 0.5 kilogram 95 RMB, additional 33 RMB per 0.5 kilogram, with a delivery time of approximately 10 days. (Note: EU customs clearance procedures significantly delay delivery.)

Shipping to Hawaii: (by air) first 0.5 kilogram 135 RMB, additional 35 RMB per 0.5 kilogram, with a delivery time of approximately 11 days.

...

I also recommand SF International Express if you don't mind roughly twice the price of the standard economy courier but offers faster delivery times, more convenience, and better service.

# Additional Notes

- If the product's warranty region is China and it is within the warranty period, the purchasing agent is obligated to contact the seller on behalf of the buyer to assist with warranty issues. However, overseas shipping cost for repairs must be borne by the buyer.
- The purchasing agent will proactively send all communication records with the seller and purchase records to the buyer to protect consumer rights.
- The purchasing agent will make every effort to help the buyer avoid customs duties. Although this is usually successful, if customs duties are imposed, they must be borne by the buyer.
- Please ensure that you inform the agent of the voltage standard in your area so that the appropriate voltage adapter can be selected for you. If the product cannot be used or is damaged due to not informing the agent of your local voltage standard, the agent will not be held responsible.
