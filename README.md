[r/ChiFiAgent](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChiFiAgent) is a community for proxy purchasing Chi-Fi products and other made-in-China gadgets. Feel free to discuss, review, or ask questions about anything related. The moderator/agent is always available for inquiries and assistance with purchasing any Chinese products, whether they are Hi-Fi items or not.

Below is the *Process and Fee Structure for Purchasing Agent Service*. If you have any questions, please contact the agent via email: <sha1rholder@outlook.com>

## Purchase of Brand New Items

1. You select the item and ask the agent to negotiate the price. Once the agent, you, and the seller agree on a price, you’ll pay a deposit—typically equal to the full item price—directly to the seller.
2. The agent purchases the item and, by default, ships it directly to the consolidation center. Only if you or the agent deem it necessary will the item be delivered to the agent’s address, opened, inspected for defects, and recorded on video. Each shipment is typically completed within 3 days.
3. You confirm the item is correct based on the images and video sent by the agent, choose your preferred shipping method, and pay the remaining balance—including the rest of the item price, shipping cost, and agent fee.
4. After receiving your payment for shipping and the agent fee, the agent records a shipping video and sends the item to you.

- If the item is counterfeit or has **obvious defects recognized by the trading platform**, you can request an exchange or a full refund.
- If you unilaterally decide you no longer want the item, you may return it within the **free return policy period** (usually 7 days after receiving it), bear the return shipping cost and receive a refund minus a 5% restocking fee (capped at 200 CNY).

The agent fee for this method is **2% of the item price**, with a minimum of **49 CNY** and a maximum of **349 CNY**.

## Purchase of Second-hand Items

1. You select the item and ask the agent to negotiate the price. Once the agent, you, and the seller agree on a price, you’ll pay a deposit—typically equal to the full item price—directly to the seller.
2. The agent purchases the item and waits for it to arrive (usually within 4 days).
3. Upon receiving the item, the agent opens and inspects it, records a video to document its condition, and sends the inspection video to you.
4. You confirm the item is correct based on the images and video sent by the agent, choose your shipping method, and pay the remaining balance—including the rest of the item price, shipping cost, and agent fee.
5. After receiving your payment for shipping and the agent fee, the agent records a shipping video and sends the item to you.

- If the item is counterfeit or has **obvious defects recognized by the trading platform**, you can request an exchange or a full refund.

The agent fee for this method is **3% of the item price**, with a minimum of **69 CNY** and a maximum of **489 CNY**.

# Payment Methods

**Alipay** is the preferred payment method **for Asian customers** in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea (partial), Philippines (partial), and Vietnam (partial). Cross-border payment fees depend on the amount and your location (usually minimal). You can ask the agent for a payment QR code or provide your Alipay account (phone number with country code) to receive a payment request.

<!-- > Alipay is currently unavailable. -->

If you use **PayPal** for payment, you may be charged a 5% cross-border fee.
Pay via PayPal: <https://paypal.me/hqywygd>

<!-- > PayPal payments are currently unavailable. -->

If you use a **VISA card** for payment, your bank may charge a flat fee, and the exact rate varies by institution. Transfers usually take about one business day.
Pay via bank transfer:

```txt
Destination country: China
SWIFT / BIC code: CMBCCNBS or CMBCCNBSXXX
Beneficiary's Bank: China Merchants Bank, H.O. Shenzhen, China
Account number / IBAN: 6214 8557 1371 0776

<!-- > VISA transfer is currently unavailable. -->

Banks generally do not require recipients to explain the source of small cross-border remittances, but if you include a remark, they may request clarification—which can delay processing. You’re free to decide whether to include a remark.

Once your payment is confirmed, you can ask the agent for a screenshot of the receipt.

# Shipping, Postage, and Delivery Time

To ensure your package is delivered promptly and accurately, please provide the following information in this exact format:

```txt
Recipient's Full Name (as on passport)
Country
State/Province
City
Detailed Address
Postal Code
Phone Number (including country code)
Email
Declared Value (optional)
Remarks (optional)
```

## Declared Value

The declared value **may** affect customs duties. A higher declared value could lead to higher taxes, while a lower one might increase the chance of customs inspection. If you’re unsure, the agent can recommend a suitable declared value. **The agent will do their best to help you minimize or avoid customs costs.** To date, none of the agent’s customers have been charged customs duties.

**Note:** While no duties have been incurred to date, this isn’t guaranteed in the future.

## Postage

**The following is for reference only. Postage rates and delivery times are subject to change.** A package roughly the size of a Hifiman Arya is typically treated as 2kg by couriers. Examples:

- **United States**: 74 CNY/kg + 98 CNY ~6 days by air
- **Hawaii**: 70 CNY/kg + 100 CNY ~8 days by air
- **Malaysia**: 29.5 CNY/kg ~4 days by air; 10.5 CNY/kg + 10 CNY ~10+ days by sea
- **Europe**: 58 CNY/kg + 66 CNY ~10 days by air (EU customs clearance often causes delays.)
- **United Kingdom**: 46 CNY/kg + 32 CNY ~9 days by air
- ...

The agent also recommends **SF International Express** if you’re willing to pay roughly double the standard economy courier rate for faster delivery, greater convenience, and better service.

If your deposit exceeds the total amount due (including product price and shipping), the agent can refund the difference via PayPal or any method you prefer.

# Additional Notes

- If the product’s warranty is valid only in China and still within the warranty period, the agent will contact the seller on your behalf to assist with warranty claims. However, **you are responsible for any overseas shipping costs related to repairs**.
- The agent will proactively share all communication records with the seller and purchase documentation with you to protect your rights as a consumer.
- The agent will make every effort to help you avoid customs duties. While this has been consistently successful so far, **any duties imposed by customs must be paid by you**.
- Please inform the agent of your local voltage standard so the correct adapter can be selected. If the product becomes unusable or is damaged due to incorrect voltage caused by your failure to provide this information, the agent will not be liable.
